# TechNest Portfolio - Website

## Overview

This document details the design and development of the TechNest Portfolio website. The website was initially designed in Figma as part of the Level 2 Interactive Media Design course at Algonquin College. It was then developed using the Bootstrap framework to fulfill the requirements of the MTM6201 course. The website is fully responsive, adapting seamlessly to various devices, including desktop, tablet, and mobile. The portfolio consists of three pages: HOME, ABOUT, and CONTACT.

## Design and Implementation

### Structure

The Contact page includes a simple contact form on the left side and contact information on the right. The design ensures that all elements are clearly visible and accessible across different screen sizes.

### Responsiveness

Using Bootstrap's grid system and utility classes, the page layout adjusts fluidly from large desktop screens to smaller mobile devices. The contact form and contact details are stacked on top of each other on smaller screens, while they are aligned side by side on larger screens.

### Accessibility

Alt text has been added to images, and semantic HTML has been used throughout the page to enhance accessibility. Skip links and aria roles have been implemented where necessary.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For structuring the content on the page.
- **CSS**: Custom styles to complement Bootstrap and enhance the design.
- **Bootstrap**: For responsive layout and styling.
- **Javascript**: For some simple functionalities.
- **FontAwesome**: For icons used in the contact information section.

## Challenges and Learning

Developing this page helped me deepen my understanding of responsive design and Bootstrap's grid system. I faced challenges with ensuring consistent layout and spacing across different screen sizes, but by using Bootstrap's utilities and custom CSS, I was able to create a cohesive and responsive design.
